# HW for Feb2
## What's your favorite game and why?
#### My favorite game is *Valorant*. I like it because it has colorful and bright scenes; great music, especially the main menu ones(fav are Ep6 ActIII Ep7 ActI); and lastly, lots of agents with unique background and abilities. Also, for someone who hasn't played any fps game before, this one feels easy to get started.
